Isolation

This was a project to build a HTTP Proxy server, that would prefetch data, on a given webpage while a user is online. This data would be stored, and then used to provide a seemless transition to offline browsing.

The plan was to monitor the traffic though the proxy and establish a users favourite sites. These would be prefetched and cached.

In the event that the user takes the machine offline the browser would be served pages from the cache creating a offline line experience without prior consideration

Currently only the base HTTP server and client implementations exists. Work did carry on beyond this but was lost in a "life changing" data failure.
